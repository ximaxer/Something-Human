Hello! Thank you for downloading the Mechanical Pixel Art GUI. Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and make sense of this zip file.

BEFORE YOU START:
I recommend becoming familiar with nine-slices. Read more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-slice_scaling
Buttons, windows, and panels are split into nine "slices." Imagine a 3x3 grid. You can name each grid square as follows: top-left, top-center, top-right, center-left, center, center-right, bottom-left, bottom-center, and bottom-right. You'll notice a lot of files in this zip have names like that! Now, imagine you stretch that 3x3 grid. Imagine that the corner pieces stay the same size, and all other pieces stretch to fit. That's nine-slice scaling! The Wikipedia page linked above has a great picture illustrating this.

SPECIAL NOTE FOR MECHANICAL GUI:
This GUI has parts that not only stretch, but *repeat* as well. When using the nine-slices, please adjust your texture UV to repeat the textures properly!

- In the root folder, you will find four folders. These folders correspond to each component type of the GUI.

- "button" folder: In this folder you will find all buttons, sorted by color theme. In each folder...
	- There are nine-slice buttons here that you can use to create any size of button.
	- There are also premade buttons of sizes 12x12, 16x16, and 24x24.
	- Buttons have three states. You can see them in the filenames.
		- Up: The normal state of the button.
		- Over: The mouseover state of the button.
		- Down: The pressed state of the button.
	- Checkboxes are also in this folder. Please see the icons folder for checkmark-related graphics.

- "icons" folder: Contains all icons included in the asset pack.
	- In this folder you will find two subfolders, "outlined" and "simple". Choose the icon style you want!
	- In either style folder, you will find icons sorted by color theme.
	- To use them with the buttons in your program, simply draw the icon on top of the button.

- "notification" folder: Contains some bonus notification graphics.

- "window" folder: In this folder you'll find all window-related graphics, sorted by color theme. In each folder...
	- The following nine-slice graphics are included:
		- Window
		- Undecorated window (no title bar)
		- Header panel (2 styles per color theme)
		- Panel (includes arrow point to attach to sides)
		- Subpanel (includes arrow point to attach to sides)
		- Area (includes "over" state and optional resizable bottom-right corner)
		- Subarea (includes "over" state and optional resizable bottom-right corner)
		- Scrollbars, progress meters, horizontal and vertical rules
	- Scrollbar graphics are in this folder. These are three-slices, which means you can scale or repeat the middle piece to make the element any length.
	- Scrollbar scrubbers and slider scrubbers are also here. Like buttons, they have up/over/down states.
	- Progress meters and horizontal/vertical rules are also included in this folder. These are three-slices, which means you can scale or repeat the middle piece to make the element any length.

- Be sure to check out the included example images to see how to put the GUI together.
